Formatting Help
----
Noted uses Markdown - For more information on Markdown, see [this link](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown Syntax"). To get started quickly, here's how to create headers in markdown:
    # Header 1
    ## Header 2
    ### Header 3
    #### Header 4
    ##### Header 5
    ###### Header 6

To create line breaks, add two spaces on the end of a line. You can make horizonal rules with 4 hyphens, seperated by spaces. To create a list, replace bullets with a asterik (Example: " * Complete this document."), and for numbered lists, use a number followed by a period (Example: "1. Complete this document.").  
To add code to a markdown document, creat a indent of 4 spaces and paste your code. Each line on the code block should be 4 spaces wide before the code begins. To add a blockquote use a less than sign.
    > This is a blockquote.
This creates:
> This is a blockquote.

To create a link or an image, you need to do the following:  
<pre><code>[This is a hyperlink](http://url.to.resource.com/ "Title")
![This is a image](http://imgur.com/i/someimage.png "Optional Title")
</code></pre>
