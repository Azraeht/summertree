## Building this code

Summertree is based on the awesome work of the people at GitHub and as
such we use the fantastic `electron` framework to get stuff done. We have
introduced a new build system based on the GNU Makefile build system. Should the
build below fail, you should run `make clean` before trying again because some
make operations won't complete if they've errored. Nothing we can do to fix
this.

Guard is used to watch every modification on sources files and launch make each time
Summertree is written in CoffeeScript and uses Spine.JS for MVC.

For web version of summertree, use 'cake'
