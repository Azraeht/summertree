## Building this code

Summertree is based on the awesome work of the people at GitHub and as
such we use the fantastic `electron` framework to get stuff done. We have
introduced a new build system based on the GNU Makefile build system. Should the
build below fail, you should run `make clean` before trying again because some
make operations won't complete if they've errored. Nothing we can do to fix
this.

### Build

    sudo gem install sass
    git submodule update --init
    make

### Start

    npm start

If you're feeling awesome, you should contribute either with code.

Springseed is written in CoffeeScript and uses Spine.JS for MVC.
