# Springseed

**Current Version: 2.0**

Springseed is the simple and easy way to take your notes.

## Building this code.
Springseed is now based on the awesome work of the people at Github and as such we use the fantastic `atom-shell` framework to get stuff done. As such, we have introduced a new build system based on the GNU Makefile build system. Should the build below fail, you should run `make clean` before trying again because some make operations won't complete if they've errored. Nothing we can do to fix this :).

    sudo gem install sass
    make

If you're feeling awesome, you should contribute either with code or a [donation](http://getspringseed.com/donate). Check out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/consindo/notes/issues) and tackle an issue.

Springseed is written in CoffeeScript and uses Spine.JS for MVC.
