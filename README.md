# Springseed

Springseed is the simple and easy way to take your notes.

## Building this code.
Springseed is now based on the awesome work of the people at Github and as such we use the fantastic `atom-shell` framework to get stuff done. As such, we have introduced a new build systembased on the GNU Makefile build system.

    sudo gem install sass
    make
