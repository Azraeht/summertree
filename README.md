Notes
=====

A note taking app.

## How to Use
Notes uses CoffeeScript. Install CoffeeScript with `npm install -g coffee-script`. Then use `coffee -o javascript/ -cw coffeescript/` to compile it. Notes also uses SASS & Compass. Install Compass with `gem install compass`. Then use `compass watch` to compile it.

You can avoid all this if you just use CodeKit.
