This twitter account will provide updates about what is going on with Springseed, as well as announce new versions of springseed and what's going on with development of Springseed. You can also follow @MichealHarker for more off-topic banter about Springseed.\n\n# What to expect\n\nSpringseed 2.0 is a major release, and we plan to chage to a more rapid development scheme. This means that we plan to release changes more rapidly than before, which means newer versions will be released through our repo on Linux, and OS X users will be informed of newer versions through a notice on their clients.\n\n# 3.0 and the future\n\nIn the future we expect to release an Android application, and prehaps a iOS application, as well as have a online version of Springseed."
