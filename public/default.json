To share a note, you can press the share button, which is the third button to the left on the header on the top. This note will then be released to the rest of the world, isn't that brilliant?\n\n# Springseed Pro\n\nSpringseed Pro is now here, for a one-time payment of $8. This small contribution goes towards development of new features as well as full support for newer online features such as sharing and, in the future, commenting and starring all from online.\n\n# Springseed 2.0 Changelog\n* Overhauled UI\n* Accounts\n* Sharing\n* Pro\n* Backend API\n* Bug fixes\n\n# @SpringseedNotes\n\nWe now have a twitter, available at @SpringseedNotes. This twitter account will provide updates about what is going on with Springseed, as well as announce new versions of springseed and what's going on with development of Springseed. You can also follow @MichealHarker for more off-topic banter about Springseed.\n\n# What to expect\n\nSpringseed 2.0 is a major release, and we plan to chage to a more rapid development scheme. This means that we plan to release changes more rapidly than before, which means newer versions will be released through our repo on Linux, and OS X users will be informed of newer versions through a notice on their clients.\n\n# 3.0 and the future\n\nIn the future we expect to release an Android application, and prehaps a iOS application, as well as have a online version of Springseed."
